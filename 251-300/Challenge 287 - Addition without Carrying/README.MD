For this challenge, forget everything you know about adding two large numbers together.

You'll be adding two numbers together without carrying numbers. Write a function that will take two numbers as input and will add them together without carrying. Write down every value you get.

Examples
2 + 11 = 13

16 + 18 = 214
1 + 1 = 2
6 + 8 = 14

122 + 81 = 1103
1 + 0 = 1
8 + 2 = 10
2 + 1 = 3

Tests
1222 + 30277
1236 + 30889
49999 + 49999
